<p>Since I'm soon to be on the technology job market, I decided to get
a handle on where the major technology companies were located.  After
spending some quality time going back and forth bettween the "Career"
sections of different companies and Google Maps, I assembled this:</p>

<iframe width="620" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=208032600690328075247.0004d67c37273c82e2363&amp;msa=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=33.578015,-96.767578&amp;spn=34.833124,56.25&amp;z=4&amp;output=embed"></iframe>

<p>There are a number of disclaimers here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is geared primarily toward locations that emphasize
    software engineering roles.  I tried to filter accordingly if there
    are few/no engineering jobs listed for a paricular location, but
    that may not be perfect either.</li>
  <li>Few companies provided the exact address (Microsoft being one of
    the exceptions) for every one of their locations, so if Google
    Maps searches failed, then I just approximated.</li>
  <li>This is certainly not exhaustive; many companies (namely Amazon)
    have many subsidiaries under different branding, which may or may
    not have any engineering roles.</li>
  <li>This doesn't include data centers, retail stores, etc.</li>
</ul>

me know</a> if you see any gross errors, or would like me to include
any other companies with more than one location.  You can get a better
