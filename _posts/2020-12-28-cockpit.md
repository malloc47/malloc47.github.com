title: Building a Personal Dashboard in ClojureScript

After the 100th time checking the weather before heading out the door
in the morning, I came to the realization that having a tablet mounted
near my front door with relevant information would be useful. In
anticipation of venturing outdoors more regularly in a post-vaccine
world, I decided to build a personal dashboard as my pandemic project.

There is a lot of prior art in this space, from the [Magic Mirror][1]
Raspberry-Pi-deployed dashboard intended to be embedded in a DIY
mirror to lightweight customizable [iPad apps][2] that have all the
common personal dashboard features out-of-the-box. For my part, I
wanted to balance the customizability associated with a DIY project
with the lightweight-ness of a solution that runs entirely on a
tablet. I specifically wanted to customize the particular APIs used,
including some less common sources like local transit times. Much as
I'm not a frontend developer, there's no more lightweight solution
than building everything in a [SPA][3] and there no language I prefer
more when dealing with the frontend than [ClojureScript][4].

Let's look at the final project before diving in deeper:

The highlights worth calling out:

- The dashboard is divided into "Cards" using a responsive grid layout
  and styled with [Material-UI][5].

- Data for each card is polled at a regular interval with a timer in
  the bottom of each card showing the time elapsed since the data was
  last fetched and a "refresh" button to fetch the data right away.

- The weather card is sourced from the [Open Weather Map API][6] with
  icon styling provided by the [Weather Icons][7] font. It includes
  typical low/high, forecast, and precipitation information.

- The clock card is self-explanatory--the time is obtained from a
  plain Javascript `Date()` call which returns the system date/time in
  the local timezone. This card also includes a sunrise and sunset
  time that are conveniently included in the Open Weather Map API
  payload.

- Stock data is pulled from the [IEX Cloud API][8] and styled with
  [react-sparklines][9]. There are a ton of choices to get stock data
  of varying levels of quality, granularity, and cost. The IEX Cloud
  has minute-level intraday stock prices and a free tier that covers
  enough queries to fetch a handful of stocks every few minutes
  for a month, so it ranks as "good enough" to drive a casual
  dashboard.

- The transit card contains rows with arrival times at a transit stop
  (arrows indicating cardinal direction at the stop). The data source
  here is an [Open Trip Planner][11] instance loaded with the
  [GTFS][11] feeds from the particular transit agency in
  question. GTFS can be ingested/served without an OTP instance but
  OTP's ingestion tools are able to parse both realtime and static
  GTFS sources on a schedule and the OTP [Index API][12] provides a
  REST interface to query this data. Most importantly, some
  agencies--in addition to publishing their raw GTFS feeds--host a
  public OTP instance for their own routing tools, removing any need
  to host the OTP instance for this dashboard. For especially large
  agencies like the [MTA][13], having a configured OTP instance with
  feeds for subways, buses, and ferries already available saved me
  significant time and bandwidth.

The rest of this post is going to go over the skeleton of the
dashboard. Later posts will deep-dive into the more complicated
aspects of each individual card.
