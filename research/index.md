[CV](http://www.malloc47.com/wp-content/uploads/research/cv.pdf) | [Lab](http://cvl.cse.sc.edu) | [Department](http://www.cse.sc.edu) | [College](http://www.engr.sc.edu) | [University](http://www.sc.edu)

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [computer science](http://www.cse.sc.edu/) at the [University of South Carolina](http://sc.edu/). Specifically, I study [computer vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) with an emphasis on [image segmentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_%28image_processing%29), [document image analysis](http://www.ias.ac.in/sadhana/Pdf2002Feb/pe989.pdf), and video event recognition. Currently, I do research (and manage the network) at the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvl.cse.sc.edu), and I additionally spend some time at the [Center for Digital Humanities](http://cdh.sc.edu). I've been funded by graduate teaching assistantships, [NSF](http://www.gk12.org) and [NEH](http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/digitalhumanitiesstartup.html) fellowships, and several otheï»¿r sources, as detailed in my [CV](http://www.malloc47.com/wp-content/uploads/research/cv.pdf).
