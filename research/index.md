I study [computer vision][1] with an emphasis on [image segmentation][2], [document image analysis][3], and video event recognition. Currently, I do research at the [Computer Vision Lab][4]. I've been funded by graduate teaching assistantships, [NSF][5], [NEH][6], [DARPA][7], and [AFOSR][15], as detailed in my [CV](/cv.pdf) and more briefly in my [résumé](/resume.pdf).

# Code

- I maintain [Ratio Contour][16], a graph-driven contour grouping
  algorithm developed at the computer vision lab.
  
- An old version of my dissertation work on materials volume
  segmentation is available [here][17].  A much cleaner version is
  forthcoming.
  
- Some of my work on [Sapheos][18], a document image analysis project
  for ancient manuscripts, is available [here][19].
