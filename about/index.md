My name is Jarrell Waggoner (ʤɛɹәl wægәnɹ̩, in
[IPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA)).  I'm a developer and
(presently) graduate student in Computer Science.  I thrive on backend
problems with an emphasis on big data and and algorithms.

Over the years, I've been known as a programmer, developer, system
administrator, researcher, student, instructor, tutor, film score
composer, digital modeler/animator, image editor, video editor, film
director, graphics designer, web developer, typesetter, and writer
(technical and nontechnical), and probably other things as well. I
love being a computing generalist, but more recently I have focused
specifically on research and software development.

I love working on interesting problems, especially those that require
specialized algorithms or involve large datasets.  Feel free to
[email](mailto:malloc47@gmail.com) me to discuss anything that might
vaguely fit into one of those categories.

## What will you find here?

My interests are obscure and varied, though appreciation for film
scores is my one pastime that has generated more useless trivia than
any other. I occasionally dabble in the composition of film scores (in
a rather amateur capacity), and I'll soon endeavor to have a section
dedicated to these experiments.  Partly to score something, I
assembled a [movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7jBdt6MVw4 "Fit
For Society") edited entirely using free (libre) software.

I've been working with computer systems and software development over
the last 1.5 decades.  [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) is my
primary operating system, so many examples here will be targeted at
this platform.  I blog with code, and a large majority of what appears
here is problem or code-driven.  

## Why malloc47?

`malloc47` has been my internet handle since the mid-'90s. Derived,
quite simply, from the standard C command,
[malloc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc), and my favorite number,
[47](http://www.47.net/47society/).  Back in the dark ages before
compilers were as widely-distributed, I longed for a `C/C++` compiler
with which I could move beyond the simple QBASIC applications I had
been coding, so I adopted the moniker largely out of the hope that I
would get my hands on such a compiler.  I did, and the name has stuck
ever since.
