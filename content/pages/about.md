My name is Jarrell Waggoner (ʤɛɹәl wægәnɹ̩, in
[IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA)). I've worked in data science
and data engineering in a range of verticals, including digital
health, fintech, e-commerce, and research science. I thrive on deeply
technical problems, especially those in/around computer vision,
machine learning, and functional programming. I specifically look out
for projects in Clojure, Haskell, and Scala. Feel free to
[email](mailto:malloc47@gmail.com) me to discuss anything that might
vaguely fit into one of those categories.
