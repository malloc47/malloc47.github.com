"Well..." said I.

"Yes?" said it.

"I don't understand what you mean by 'happy endings' at all."

"Every single of your stories is one." It seemed insistent. It couldn't have meant what it sounded like it did; its slightly strange phrasing being (I assumed) an artifact of adapting to our complex language.

"Surely you don't believe all of our stories have a happy ending?" I added, trying to clarify things.

"Surely I do," was its reply.

"Why?"

"Because they end, happily."

I knew I wasn't going to get anywhere without examples. "But what of stories that leave all the characters expired or cadaverous?"

"But they end." Its reply so very matter-of-fact.

"Well, yes. But what of stories of lost love and unhappiness?"

"They still end."

The monotonous reply, coupled with its already colorless voice, was starting to grate me wrongly. "But what still of stories where the miscreant escapes justice?"

"They come to an end, still."

Now it was just trying to get under my skin. "You can't be serious! You can't call a villain triumphant anything but a travesty; a champion dead anything but a loss!"

It raised one of its arms. "Certainly the events are allowed less than happiness, but the story itself is still happy."

I didn't know what it was getting at. "What are you getting at?"

"Perhaps I misspoke," it said, clearly recoiling from my words (it understood verbal frustration so much more clearly than nonverbal frustration). "What I mean is that the nature of your stories is happy, by virtue of the fact that they end."

"Ah, now we are getting somewhere," I uttered, relieved. "I thought you meant that our stories end in a happy way, while you actually meant that our stories end, which is happy... right?"

"Yes, that would be it, if I understand the nuances of your language correctly." It was considerably calmer now.

"But... why?"

"Because they happily end."

"No, no, no... I mean, ummm..." I sputtered, trying to get into words what I was asking of it. "Why is the nature of an ending story happy?"

"That's a bit difficult to explain to beings subject to death--"

"Mortal," I chimed in, knowing it appreciated my attempts at improving its vocabulary.

"Yes, mortal beings. For you, endings are natural, expected, even necessary. We are not mortal, you see. Endings aren't normal for us. They're... redundant."

Its last word choice confused me, but I decided to focus my query on what was really bothering me. "Ah, I see. I understand the unfamiliarity, I suppose. But what makes them happy?"

It thought for an uncomfortable minute, trying to get its thoughts into its own words. And then from its own words into my words. "You see, the lot of us have lived for a very long time. And we have a surprisingly limited vocabulary--only a handful of what you would call 'words'--and a very rigid set of actions we are capable of performing." It paused, wondering if I had taken in the significance of the limitations it had just explained. After a moment, my nodding acknowledgement was finally satisfactory, and it continued. "After but an armful--"

"Handful."

"Yes, handful, thank you. After a handful of your lifetimes--about four hundred billion--we have, each of us individually, lived out all possible combinations of any reasonably finite series of actions that can be taken, and words that can accompany them."

"Well..." said I.

"We've lived them all," it continued.

This I did require a moment to soak in. It was plenty willing to oblige my contemplative moment. "Wait," I exclaimed, "you mean that if any of your stories were to have an ending, then you'd have already lived that story?"

"Yes, that is the very reason our stories have no endings. Nor can they."

"Why couldn't you have a story that went on just a bit longer than all the stories you've experienced, and then end it?" I puzzled.

It looked puzzled at my puzzle and then, quite rightly, replied, "by the time we had heard the recount of a story of such length, we'd have already experienced it ourselves. Nor could the crafting of such a tale be completed before we had fully experienced its contents."

"Oh, bother," I reacted. Clearly, I had not fully grasped this notion. I probed further: "So, tell me of the stories you do have."

"We may have experienced every possible permutation of events, but we still exist in time, and the order in which we experience these events is different for every one of us." It paused again. "Think of it thus: no matter which book you pick up, no matter the film you view, no matter what event you might hear recounted, everything found therein you have already experienced. But the sequence of when these things were experienced varies from one to another. That's how we tell each other apart--not by appearance, since we all share the same; not aurally or tactilely, but simply by distinction of the sequence of discrete stories we've experienced."

"Aha! So you need only find an ordering of stories that has never been experienced before to create a new, original tale?"

"That's hardly practical, since there is no telling if someone else has already experienced your crafted ordering (and yours isn't the only culture with lawyers). Neither is creating such a lengthy tale practical, nor partaking in the recounting of such a thing, as I've already said."

"But the lack of novelty doesn't make a story valueless (lawyers aside)," I posited, "many of our stories have elements we're all familiar with: birth, growing up, death--themes that don't grow tired in and of themselves."

"What if each and every one of your stories consisted of 'Once upon a time.' That, and only that. Something so familiar and universal that its existence alone without anything accompanying it is so axiomatical as to be meaningless. That is what a finite story is to us. You, being finite, only understand the example if I take an incomplete element of a story, but to us, it's entire stories that seem this tired and common."

"I don't suppose your vocabulary allows for narrative devices that makes the story uniquely inexperiential?"

"You would be right, if I understand your meaning."

It made its point clearly. "But what are your stories, then? How can they be enough?"

"Simple," it replied. "Our stories are the lives of those around us. That is enough for us"

Something was still missing, but I think I understood.
